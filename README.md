Rish's Interview Prep Repository
================================

***How to Use***

Simply clone the repository as you would any normal repository.

<code>git clone https://github.com/rishmanisation/interview-prep</code>

Should any modifications be made please update the README and Version number.

***Current Version: 1.3***

What's in this?
===============

Practice for all interviews. This repository consists of:

1.	Questions that I have encountered on websites.

2.	Questions that I have encountered in interviews (phone screens).

3.	(NEW in Version 1.3) My resume.

All code is written in Java (unless the question otherwise specifies). Links to the respective questions can usually be found in a comment on the first line of the file. Over time, I do plan to convert all comments to the javadoc format, in which case things might change. Further, if I combine multiple functions under one class (could be different implementations or something like various functions pertaining to a data structure), the link to the question can be found in a comment above the respective function.
