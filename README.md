interview-prep
==============

(Version 1.2)

Practice for all interviews. This repository consists of:

1.	Questions that I have encountered on websites such as Hackerrank (in progress) and LeetCode (coming soon!).

2.	Questions that I have encountered in interviews (phone screens).

All code is written in Java (unless the question otherwise specifies). Links to the respective questions can usually be found in a comment on the first line of the file. Over time, I do plan to convert all comments to the javadoc format, in which case things might change. Further, if I combine multiple functions under one class (could be different implementations or something like various functions pertaining to a data structure), the link to the question can be found in a comment above the respective function.
